Available solvers are adiabatic (simulation), qaoa, classic. 
See python mincover.py -h for more options
The classic solver is the min vertex cover solver from nx, which is not guaranteed to give an optimal solution, and generally it does not!

For testing, it is recommended to use a small yet complex graph like graphs/dsatur.graphml.
